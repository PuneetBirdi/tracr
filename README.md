This is my first MERN application, using Redux for state management. It's an application that allows restaurants and bars to fully comply with contact tracing requirements set forth by Toronto Public Health in the wake of COVID-19.

Each user has an access level (manager or staff) that dictates what functions are available to them, and they're associated with a venue. Each party then contains a main contact, names of guests, the table they were seated at, and the name of their server.

Note: This is currently still in progress, I'm hoping to deploy an MVP to Heroku soon. In the mean time if you'd like to view the application I'd be happy to share it with you on a video call.
